# hang-man

These are the different versions of hang-man that I created in my first semester.

In version 1, I created **hang-man** with simple logic.

In version 2, I break the logic into a bunch of functions.

In version 3, I got the data from the file and store the user record to file.

### Note

Each version is created as a different assignment.
